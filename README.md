cartoonify
==========

regulizer.py: Takes an image and performs a type of averaging on the pixel RGB values to reduce the number of different colors being used. Takes in 2 parameters: threshold and mean_computation_frequency

cartoonify.py: Takes an image of a person and transforms them into a cartoon, using a list of skin tone RGB values. Doesn't work!
